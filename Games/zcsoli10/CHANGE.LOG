	* Version 1.0.

	* readme.txt: updated to reflect the changed filenames.

	* Changed filenames to all-lowercase, aside from ChangeLog which
	is renamed to/from change.log by "make zip". This is to cope with
	CP/M unzip not uppercasing filenames, by using "zip -k" to make a
	DOS-style one with uppercase names. The idea is that on Unix you
	would extract the zip with "unzip -L" to get lowercase filenames
	back, though this only really matters if you're rebuilding the
	game.

	* zcsoli.z: added a simple usage message if 1st or 2nd char on
	command-line is "?" or "h". Removed "shuffling" message, which you
	barely even got to actually see with it being so much faster in
	this version, so on Z80 the COM still fits in 2k. Just. :-)

	* zcsoli.z: no longer displays the onscreen instructions on a
	custom terminal type if cols setting is less than 50, making 32
	columns now the minimum required width. You can also do this with
	the builtin terminal types by adding "-" as a second character,
	e.g. "zcsoli 2-". The latter might be useful e.g. in 40-column
	mode on an MSX.

	* z8080.awk: fixed a very obvious bug in "sra" replacement, though
	that's not actually used by zcsoli.

	* zcsoli.z: added ^L to redraw the screen. Also fixed input bug -
	I hadn't spotted that I was mixing direct and non-direct input,
	which was causing strange behaviour on some systems.

	* zcsoli.z: added ADM-3A support, as this seems to cover quite
	a few systems/terminals. (It is, of course, entirely
	coincidental that I needed this to play it in Virtual Kaypro.)

	* CP/M version based on soliyawn, but it's 2k rather than the
	original's 1k. The 8080 version is actually over 2k! Hopefully you
	can spare the disk space. :-)
