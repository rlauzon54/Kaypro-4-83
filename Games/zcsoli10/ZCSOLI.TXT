Description
-----------

zcsoli is a one-player card game, playing the game usually called
Solitaire, Patience, or Klondike. It uses the (easier) 1-card draw
variant. It supports VT100, VT52, ADM-3A, and ZCN control codes.

There are two versions. zcsoli.com requires a Z80 or compatible CPU.
zcso8080.com uses 8080 instructions only (and should run on anything
CP/M 2.2 does), but it's slower and larger.

The aim of the game is to get all the cards in each suit onto the
matching ace pile, in ascending order (with aces low) from ace to
king. To help you do this, you can move cards onto/between the seven
main runs of cards which are dealt when you start. Any face-up cards
on those must be in descending order (K, Q, J, 10, ... 2), and have
alternating red/black suit. When moving cards between the main
"piles", you can only move entire runs (every face-up card on the
pile). When moving to a main pile which has no cards at all, you can
only move a king there (or the top card of the run you're moving must
be a king).

The main card piles are shown at the top of the screen (growing
downwards), with the deck at the bottom-left and the ace piles to the
right of that. (Initially you can't see the ace piles, as you have to
move an ace to them before there'll be anything there.)

The top of each card is indicated with two characters, the first being
a number or A/T/J/Q/K for ace/ten/jack/queen/king, the second being
H/D/s/c for hearts/diamonds/spades/clubs. While no colour is used in
the display, runs of cards can easily be found just using the
uppercase/lowercase display of the different suits.


Controls
--------

When the game runs, it initially prompts you to press a key to
continue. This is to help set up the random number generator.

Once the game starts, the keys are:

Enter (CR) - turn over a card from the top of the deck. If the deck is
empty, it flips the turned-over cards back onto the deck first.

1 to 7, or D - pick a card (or run) to move from the numbered pile or
the deck (actually the topmost turned-over card). Once you've pressed
this first key, you then choose where to move it, with 1 to 7 and A
meaning either the numbered pile, or the relevant ace pile. If you
attempt a move which isn't allowed, it'll be ignored.

Control-R - restart, abandoning the current game, and reshuffle/deal
from scratch.

Control-L - redraw the screen.

Control-C - exit the game.

If you win, you get a congratulatory message - press a key at that
point to start another game.


Terminal Support
----------------

By default, zcsoli.com expects a VT100/ANSI terminal. But you can
specify a builtin terminal type to use by running it with "zcsoli n"
where n is:

0  custom terminal as patched-in
1  VT100
2  VT52
3  ZCN
4  VC404
5  ADM-3A

Many systems/terminals are compatible with VT100, VT52, or ADM-3A, at
the simple clear-screen and cursor-move level used by the game. Here
are some examples:

CP/M emulators          VT100 or VT52 (mostly)

Amstrad CPC/PCW         VT52
Bondwell 2              ADM-3A
Commodore 128           ADM-3A
DEC Rainbow             VT100
Heathkit/Zenith         VT52
Kaypro                  ADM-3A
MSX                     VT52
Osborne                 ADM-3A
Sinclair Spectrum +3    VT52
Xerox 820               ADM-3A

The Apple II with SoftCard should partly work with ADM-3A; the
clear-screen code used will probably fail.

The TRS-80 situation is complicated due to the various models and CP/M
versions, but most should work or partly work with ADM-3A or VT52.

For ZCN, use "zcsoli 0" on NC100 and "zcsoli 3" on NC200. Both
effectively skip the bottom line; the NC100 case also skips a blank
line, and crudely rearranges things to fit the screen.

You can remove the onscreen instructions by following a terminal type
with "-", e.g. "zcsoli 2-". This limits the display to 32 columns.

If none of the builtin terminal types are any use, you'll have to
patch in support for a custom terminal... and you probably need be a
programmer to do that. But it isn't too nasty.


Custom Terminal Patching
------------------------

Hopefully you won't need to do this - see above. But if you do, note
that the screen/terminal being used should support at least 32 columns
and 22 rows of text. (Using exactly 32 columns will actually require a
minimum of 23 rows, if the cursor wraps around at EOL.) There are ways
to cope with having fewer lines in some cases, the NC100 support shows
one possible approach.

Addresses below are locations in memory when loaded, subtract 100h for
offsets in the COM file.

0104h should be the number of columns, though there's no actual need
to change this unless it's less than 50.

0107h should be a zero byte (00h) to indicate a custom terminal patch.
(It otherwise indicates a builtin terminal type to use - so e.g. you
could set this to 2 to use VT52 codes by default.)

0110h should be a clear-screen routine. Or you can leave it as-is and
just change the string at 0118h, which should end with "$".

0120h should be a cursor-move routine to move to column B and row C,
with (0,0) being the top-left.

All space from 0110h to 017Fh inclusive is available to patches. You
can use BDOS calls for output, or you can call 0180h to output DE as a
decimal number, or 0183h to output the character in A.

One more thing, which isn't really to do with terminal-patching - you
can change the filler characters used for face-up and face-down cards
if you want (the defaults being "." and "%"). They're at 0195h and
0196h respectively.

See zcsoli.z for any further details.


Building
--------

Feel free to skip this, prebuilt COM files are provided.

If you want to reassemble from scratch, you should first make sure
that the source files were extracted from the ZIP with "unzip -L", or
from the LBR with "lbrate". This is to ensure that you have
all-lowercase filenames.

You'll need a Unix/Linux box or some equivalent, and zmac 1.3 which is
available here at the time of writing:

  http://ftp.nvg.ntnu.no/pub/cpc/utils/msdos/zmac.zip

Or failing that, it's bundled with ZCN in the "zmac" directory:

  http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/packages/zcn/zcn13.zip

At least one newer fork of zmac exists, but personally I prefer 1.3.

You also need awk installed, preferably GNU awk installed as gawk.
Other awk implementations should work, but you'll need to edit
Makefile and z8080.awk appropriately to use them.

Once everything's ready, do "make spotless" in the src directory to
remove the existing binaries, then "make" which should make the COM
files.


Naming
------

Yes, it's not the best name ever. I was originally going to call it
"solitty" until I did a web search and found that the name had
basically been used already, in an amusing way I hadn't been
expecting. :-)
