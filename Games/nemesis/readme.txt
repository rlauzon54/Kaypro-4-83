WELCOME to Nemesis...a unique role-playing game modeled after the
Dungeons and Dragons epic simulations.
Very generally, Nemesis is set in pre-history in a world not
unlike the one described by J.R.R. Tolkien in the "Rings' trilogy.

The object of the game is to explore all levels of the
dungeons...and survive.
